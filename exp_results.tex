\section{Experimental Results}


\begin{table}
\caption{Properties of the outer valence spectra of mixed ArXe clusters. Spectra of pure Ar and Xe clusters are included for reference. All spectra were recorded at $h\nu = 17$~eV, except for the pure Xe clusters ($h\nu = 60$~eV). Binding energies $E_b$ were determined as the centre of gravity of the respective feature, while band width $w$ are the FWHM of a Gaussian fit. The experimental Xe content of the clusters always is higher than in the original gas mixture (see Tab.\ \protect\ref{tab:cluster}). It was determined from the areas of the respective photolines, corrected by the respective atomic photoionization cross sections (Ar 33.0 Mb, Xe 51.3 Mb)\cite{samson2002}. Uncertainties are estimated as 3\,\% for the Xe content and 0.05~eV for the binding energies. Labels given in the first column refer to the expansion parameters in Tab.\ \protect\ref{tab:cluster}. $E_b$ and $w$ are in eV, $A$ is in \%. The binding energies can be compared to atomic values of 15.82~eV, 13.43~eV and 12.13~eV for Ar 3p and Xe 5p.

 \caption{
Outer valence photoelectron spectra of mixed Ar-Xe clusters, in comparison to the pure species. Panel a) shows the outer valence region of homogeneous Ar and Xe clusters, respectively (see text for details). The two lower panels show the spectra of the mixed species of different size. Sharp lines marked `m' result from photoionization of uncondensed atoms into the Ar 3p$_{1/2,3/2}$ and Xe 5p$_{1/2,3/2}$ final states. Labels in panels b) and c) give the Xe content in the expanding gas mixture, which is lower then the Xe content observed in the heterogeneous clusters. The photon energy used was 17~eV, apart from the pure Xe cluster spectrum (60 eV).

Photon excited electron-electron coincidence spectrum of mixed Ar-Xe clusters in the inner valence region. Panel b): Color-coded map of coincident electron pairs, with the electron of higher kinetic named $e_1$. The energy of $e_1$ is given as binding energy, using the photon energy of $h\nu = 32$~eV. Panel c): Energy spectrum of primary electrons $e_1$, irrespective of the energy of the secondary electron (summation of the coincidence map along horizontal lines). The peak at a binding energy of 28.7~eV pertains to the Ar 3s photoelectron line.  Panel a): Energy spectrum of all secondary (ICD or ETMD) electrons $e_2$ pertaining to the Ar 3s binding energy region marked by two black bars. See text for details. Intensity is expressed as coincident events/pixel of 20~meV$^2$ (b) or as coincident events per interval of 20~meV (a,c). The color scale of panel b) is linear.
