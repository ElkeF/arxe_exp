   Abstract = {We use an autoionization process that involves ultrafast energy transfer to neighbouring sites to characterize the formation of NeAr van der Waals bonds in clusters formed by a coexpansion of both gases. This autoionization process, the so-called interatomic or intermolecular coulombic decay (ICD), is ubiquitous in weakly bonded systems. The energy of the electron being emitted in the ICD process is shown to be characteristic of the two neighbouring entities and is therefore suggested as a new means for structural investigation, such as interface identification, of weakly bonded complexes.},

  abstractnote = {Purpose: The paper gives an introduction into Interatomic and Intermolecular
	Coulombic Decay (ICD). ICD is an autoionization process, which contrary
	to Auger decay involves neighbouring sites of the initial vacancy
	as an integral part of the decay transition. As a result of ICD,
	slow electrons are produced which generally are known to be active
	in radiation damage. The author summarizes the properties of ICD
	and reviews a number of important experiments performed in recent
	years. Materials and methods: Intermolecular Coulombic Decay can
	generally take place in weakly bonded aggregates in the presence
	of ionizing particles or ionizing radiation. Examples collected here
	mostly use soft X-rays produced by synchrotron radiation to ionize,
	and use rare-gas clusters, water clusters or solutes in a liquid
	jet to observe ICD after irradiation. Results: Intermolecular Coulombic
	Decay is initiated by single ionization into an excited state. The
	subsequent relaxation proceeds via an ultra-fast energy transfer
	to a neighbouring site, where a second ionization occurs. Secondary
	electrons from ICD have clearly been identified in numerous systems.
	ICD can take place after primary ionization, as the second step of
	a decay cascade which also involves Auger decay, or after resonant
	excitation with an energy which exceeds the ionization potential
	of the system. Conclusions: ICD is expected to play a role whenever
	particles or radiation with photon energies above the ionization
	energies for inner valence electrons are present in weakly bonded
	matter, e.g., biological tissue. The process produces at the same
	time a slow electron and two charged atomic or molecular fragments,
	which will lead to structural changes around the ionized site.},

   Abstract = {Aqueous potassium chloride has been studied by synchrotron-radiation excited core-level photoelectron and Auger electron spectroscopy. In the Auger spectrum of the potassium ion, the main feature comprises the final states where two outer valence holes are localized on potassium. This spectrum exhibits also another feature at a higher kinetic energy which is related to final states where outer valence holes reside on different subunits. Through ab initio calculations for microsolvated clusters, these subunits have been assigned as potassium ions and the surrounding water molecules. The situation is more complicated in the Auger spectrum of the chloride anion. One-center and multicenter final states are present here as well but overlap energetically.},

	decay mechanisms of subvalence vacancies in the argon and krypton
	dimers and trimers are discussed both for the interatomic Coulombic
	decay and the electron transfer mediated decay (ETMD). In the heteronuclear
	triatomic system which serves as a model for larger clusters, a possible
	ETMD process of the Ar 3s vacancy is found for the linear arrangement

  abstractnote = {The electronic and geometric structure of rare gas clusters doped
	with rare-gas atoms Rg = Xe, Kr or Ar is investigated with fluorescence
	excitation spectroscopy in the VUV spectral range. Several absorption
	bands are observed in the region of the first electronic excitations
	of the impurity atoms, which are related to the lowest spin-orbit
	split atomic 3P1 and 1P1 states. Due to influence of surrounding
	atoms of the cluster, the atomic lines are shifted to the blue and
	broadened ( electronical cage effect ). From the known interaction
	potentials and the measured spectral shifts the coordination of the
	impurity atom in ArN, KrN, NeN and HeN could be studied in great
	detail. In the interior of KrN and ArN the XeÂ atoms are located
	in substitutional sites with 12Â nearest neighbours and internuclear
	distances comparable to that of the host matrix. In NeN and HeN the
	cluster atoms (18 and 22, respectively) arrange themselves around
	the Xe impurity with a bondlength comparable to that of the heteronuclear
	dimer. The results confirm that He clusters are liquid while Ne clusters
	are solid for Nâ‰¥ 300. Smaller Ne clusters exhibit a liquid like
	behaviour. When doping is strong, small Rgm-clusters (Rg = Xe, Kr,
	Ar, mâ‰¤10 2) are formed in the interior sites of the host cluster
	made of Ne or He. Specific electronically excited states, assigned
	to interface excitons are observed. Their absorption bands appear
	and shift towards lower energy when the cluster size m increases,
	according to the Frenkel exciton model. The characteristic bulk excitons
	appear in the spectra, only when the cluster radius exceeds the penetration
	depth of the interface exciton, which can be considerably larger
	than that in free Rgm clusters. This effect is sensitive to electron
	affinities of the guest and the host cluster.},

  abstract = {Following innervalence ionization of a cluster, the system can relax
	by electron emission, a phenomenon called intermolecular Coulombic
	decay. This process is characterized by an efficient energy transfer
	mechanism between neighboring monomers in the cluster. A theoretical
	description within the framework of Wigner-Weisskopf theory is developed,
	thus enabling a detailed analysis of the decay process. The main
	result of the formal treatment, a simple, approximate expression
	for the electronic decay width of an innervalence hole state, is
	applied to investigate the effect of cluster size. On the basis of
	extensive ab initio calculations, pronounced size effects are found
	in the concrete example of neon clusters. The decay lifetime decreases
	in a monotonic fashion from hundred femtoseconds in Ne2 down to less
	than ten femtoseconds in Ne13. Suggestions are made how to facilitate
	the experimental observation of intermolecular Coulombic decay in
	clusters and condensed matter.}
