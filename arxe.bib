	(ILJ). The ILJ potential eliminates most of the inadequacies at short-
	and long-range of the LJ model. Further reliability tests have been
	performed by comparing calculated vibrational spacings with experimental
	values and calculated interaction energies at short-range with those
	obtained from the inversion of gaseous transport properties. The
	analysis{,} extended also to systems involving ions{,} suggests that
	the ILJ potential model can be used to estimate the behavior of unknown
	systems and can help to assess the different role of the leading
	interaction components. Moreover{,} due to its simple formulation{,}
	the physically reliable ILJ model appears to be particularly useful
